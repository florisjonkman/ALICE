# ALICE

Dear scientist,

This repository is setup to document and store all macros that I have created in my analysis for the ALICE Collaboration at NIKHEF. In my project I analyzed the charm baryon production at central rapidity as a function of multiplicity in proton-proton collisions at âˆš13 TeV. A full overview of my project can be found in my [Master Thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rymgot1xvugtamg/20200120_Master_Thesis_Floris_Jonkman.pdf?dl=0). In addition to this I created a [Analysis Note](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ns8b1lddz2fqp7u/20200120_Analysis_Note_Floris_Jonkman.pdf?dl=0) which contains all the technical information about the analysis. If one has question please send me [Mail](mailto:floris.publicmail@gmail.com?subject=Github:Alice), with 'Github:Alice' as subject.

Thanks,

Floris Jonkman
